# The Difference Engine

https://math.madmodels3d.com/

A simple calculator for graphing and standard arithmetic operations. This app uses mathjs to execute calculations on typed input (strings). It also uses Mathjax and Katex to render human-readable equations and formulas in the browser. This is a progressive web app that can be downloaded onto any device for offline use.

The title (The Difference Engine) is inspired by the mechanical calculator designed in the 1820s and created by Charles Babbage (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine).
